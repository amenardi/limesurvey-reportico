To get going there are two useful report projects already setup and you will find them under the plugins/Reportico/components/projects under your Limesurvey installation. They are in folders named "tutorials" and "examples". You need to copy these to the tmp/runtime/reportico/projects under your Limesurvey installation.
After doing this, they wil appear as available projects in your Reportico admin page within Limesurvey.

The "examples" project provides 3 exaple reports on your survey database.

The "tutorials" project allows you set up  sample dataset in your database which you can run through the standard set of reportico tutorials which will teach you all about the features of Reportico. You can run through this by following the instructions here.
